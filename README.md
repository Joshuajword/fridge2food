# fridge2food
A mobile forward, web based application which allows you to find recipes based on the available ingredients in your house. Additionally, we will include a feature to order missing ingredients from other recipes.
tl:dr - search recipes from ingredients on hand

Fridge2Food will strive to make cooking easier by eliminating the need to either shop for ingredients that are not currently available to you, or searching through numerous recipes to find one that you can make with only what is available to you.

Future updates will include: 
1.) an api that will allow the search of multiple ingredients with the resulting recipes appearing
2.) an api will will add ingredients from additional recipes that are not available to you currently into a search for local markets, and an instacart that will be filled with them for purchase and/or delivery, should you choose

Technology used for this project:
web based api's from instacart and //recipe web api//, as well as HTML, and finally Bulma for CSS

Project participants are: Joshua Ballard, Mihir Patel, and Jeffrey Young
